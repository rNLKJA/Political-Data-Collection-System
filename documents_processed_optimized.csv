"September 29, 2024","Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Las Vegas, Nevada",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-vice-president-campaign-event-las-vegas-nevada-0,Kamala Harris,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/people/other/kamala-harris,1,0,"Remarks by the Vice President at a Campaign Event in Las Vegas, Nevada",2024-09-29T00:00:00+00:00,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hey, Las Vegas. (Applause.)\n\nGood evening, Nevada. (Applause.) Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. (Applause.) (Inaudible.)\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\nThank you all. Thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\nAnd can we please hear it for Captain Quintero? (Applause.)\n\nOh, thank you all. Thank you, everyone. Oh, it is so wonderful to be back in Nevada. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\nAnd happy Hispanic Heritage Month to everyone. (Applause.)\n\nThank you. Thank you all. It's good to be back, and I want to thank everyone for all that you do.\n\nI know we have some extraordinary elected leaders here, and I want to thank them for their incredible work and friendship. It is good to be with all the leaders who are here, including Representative Susie Lee, who is here — (applause); Steven Horsford — (applause); Dina Titus — (applause); the great General Ford — (applause); Senator Catherine Cortez Masto — (applause); Senator Jacky Rosen, who we're going to send back to the United States Senate. (Applause.)\n\nThank you, everyone, and all the local leaders here. There are so many leaders here. It is good to be back with you. (Applause.)\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nAnd wait a minute. We also tonight have here some of the Vegas Raiders, who won their game tonight. (Applause.) Thank you. Congratulations. Oh, congratulations. You came right from the game. Congratulations.\n\nGive them an applause, right? (Applause.) Well done. Well done. Well done.\n\nSo, in all seriousness, everyone, before I begin, I want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. And please have a seat if you're able.\n\nI want to talk about Hurricane Helene for a moment, and I know that everyone here sends their thoughts and prayers for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane and the ensuing events in Florida, in Georgia, the Carolinas, and other impacted states. And we know that so many have been impacted; some have died.\n\nBut I want to thank everyone for doing everything you can to think about them. Send them your thoughts. Send them your prayers.\n\nI want to thank the first responders who have done so much. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we will stand with these communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild.\n\nEarlier today, I received an operational briefing from FEMA Director Criswell. More than 3,300 federal personnel have been mobilized. We are deploying food, water, and generators and working to restore water and power. (Applause.)\n\nAnd the president and I have told state and local leaders we will provide whatever help they need in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nAnd so, I thank you all for sending your best wishes to everyone there. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\nSo, Las Vegas, we have 37 days until the election. (Applause.) Thirty-seven days. And we know this will be a tight race until the very end.\n\nAnd let's level set. We are the underdog. We are the underdog, and we have some hard work ahead.\n\nBut here's the thing. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. (Applause.)\n\nAnd with your help, we will win in November. (Applause.) Yes, we will. Yes, we will. Yes, we will.\n\nAUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win.\n\nAUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win.\n\nAUDIENCE: We will win! We will win! We will win!\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: We will win.\n\nAnd here's why — and here's why — and here's why: Because we here know that this election is about two very different visions for our nation. And the contrast, I think, was quite clear in our debate.\n\nDid you all see the debate? (Applause.) You saw — you saw the debate. You saw the debate. Yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd in two days, I know we will cheer on Coach Walz when he debates J.D. Vance. (Applause.) Yeah.\n\nBut listen, also, their debate should not be the last word. I'm trying to debate Donald Trump again and — (applause) — I think he should debate again. The American people have a right to hear us discuss the issues. And as you say here in Las Vegas, I'm all in. I'm all in — (applause) — even if my opponent is ready to fold, so there you go.\n\nBut you will remember, in our first debate, I talked about issues like bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom — (applause) — and keeping our nation secure. (Applause.)\n\nBut from Donald Trump, well, it was the same old, tired playbook — same old, tired playbook — with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people.\n\nWell, folks, it's time to turn the page. (Applause.) It's time to turn the page.\n\nAmerica is ready to chart a new way forward — (applause) — ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership — (applause) — which is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign, because we know we need a president who works for all the American people. (Applause.)\n\nEnough of the division. Enough of the hate. We are all in this together. (Applause.)\n\nAnd you all know, for my entire career, I've only had one client: the people. The people. (Applause.)\n\nFrom being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators. (Applause.) As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks — (applause) — and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. (Applause.) I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for-profit colleges — (applause) — for workers who were being cheated out of their wages. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I pledge to you, as president, I will fight for all Americans. And together, we will build a brighter future for our nation. (Applause.)\n\nWe will build a future that includes thinking about our economy in a way that it is about lifting everyone up. We will build what I call an ""opportunity economy"" so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business. (Applause.)\n\nAnd let me tell you, I love our small businesses, of which I've met so many right here in Vegas. (Applause.)\n\nYou know, growing up, our mother worked very long hours, and so, my sister Maya and I would go over two doors down to Ms. Shelton's house. She — we called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner. So, I know, since I was a young child, who our small businesses are, who our small-business owners are.\n\nSmall businesses are the backbone of America's economy. (Applause.) I know that. I know that. And Latina small-business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy. (Applause.)\n\nSo, my plan is about tapping into that ambition, those aspirations, those dreams, those incredible ideas, that strong work ethic that people have, also understanding not everybody gets handed $4 million on a silver platter and files for bankruptcy six times.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: So, my plan is about saying we've got to help entrepreneurs, startups out, and I will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses. (Applause.) Because right now, that tax deduction is $5,000. Can't nobody start a small business in 2024. So, we're going — we are going to make it something what — where it is doable to lift folks up.\n\nWe also need to build more housing in America. (Applause.) My mother saved up for years, until I was a teenager, when she was able to buy our first home. And right now, a serious housing shortage is part of what is driving up cost. So, we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes — (applause) — and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 down-payment assistance — (applause) — so you can just get your foot in the door. You'll do the rest.\n\nAnd we must lower the cost of living, because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it.\n\nSo, I have a plan that includes lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries, including I will take on the corporate price gouging that we know — (applause) — has resulted in jacking prices up, often around tragedies and emergencies.\n\nWe will give a tax cut to 100 million more Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child's life — (applause) — knowing that the vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well but not always the resources to do it. And that $6,000 in extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit will help buying a crib, buying a car seat, doing the things that are so critical in that first phase of life.\n\nI will also make sure good-paying jobs are available to all Americans, not only those with college degrees. (Applause.) Because we need to recognize the value of additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs. (Applause.) And so, as president, part of how I'm going to push this forward is I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs — (applause) — understanding that having a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a worker. (Applause.) And when we do that with the federal workforce, I'm coming to ask the private sector — challenge you to do the same. (Applause.)\n\nSo, all of this is to say I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. (Applause.) Never.\n\nNow, Donald Trump has a different plan.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Just google ""Project 2025.""\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Which, I have to say, I still can't believe they put that thing in writing. (Laughter.) They printed it up. They bound it. They handed it out. Just google it. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he would do if he were elected again as president.\n\nDonald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts again —\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: — cut Social Security and Medicare —\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: — and impose what I call a ""Trump sales tax,"" which would be a 20 percent tax on everyday basic necessities —\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: — which economists have measured would cost the average family nearly 4,000 more dollars a year in everyday expenses.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And he has no plan to replace it.\n\nHe has, quote, ""concepts of a plan."" (Applause.) ""Concepts.""\n\nSo, here's the thing, though. We can laugh about many things, but the consequences of this are quite serious — quite serious. Because think about it: He's going to threaten health coverage and health insurance for 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. You remember what that was like?\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we are not going back. (Applause.) We are not going back.\n\nAUDIENCE: We're not going back! We're not going back! We're not going back!\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: We're not going back. We — we will move forward and — (applause) — and we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation.\n\nWe have talked about the economy. We have talked about what we can do in terms of investing in the ambition, the aspirations of our country. We will take on the issue of immigration. We will take on a number of issues.\n\nOn the subject of immigration, we must have comprehensive immigration reform — (applause) — with strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship — (applause) — including for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years, including our DREAMers — (applause) — including our DREAMers.\n\nAnd I was attorney general of a border state. I prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. And as president, I will double the resources for the Department of Justice to go after those transnational cartels — (applause) — and take action to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into our country, which is destroying entire communities. (Applause.)\n\nThese are serious problems, and we know Donald Trump won't solve them.\n\nWhen he was president, he did nothing to fix our immigration system. (Applause.) And earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades, and Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought that that bill, if passed, would have hurt him, and he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. That's not the kind of president we want.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: As president, he cruelly separated families and plans to do it again.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And he continues to fan the flames of fear and division.\n\nLook, we need a president who cares more about solving problems than playing political games and demeaning people full\n\ntime. (Applause.) We're tired of that. We're — we're done with that.\n\nSo, Nevada, ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court — the court of Thurgood and RBG —\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: — so that they would do as they did and overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade. And now one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban —\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: — many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. It is immoral. Immoral.\n\nAnd let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. (Applause.) If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do with her body. (Applause.) Come on.\n\nAnd with Jacky Rosen back in the United States Senate — (applause) — when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (Applause.) Proudly sign it into law.\n\nAnd, Nevada, you know I'm traveling all over our country. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to join a union, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride — (applause) — and the freedom to be safe from gun violence — (applause) — which after 1 October Nevada proved that smart gun safety laws are just common sense. (Applause.)\n\nSo, look, generations before us, generations of America led the fight for freedom, and the baton — well, it's now in our hands. It's now in our hands. (Applause.)\n\nAnd it all comes down to this. We are here together. You came out on a Sunday evening. We are here together because we know what is at stake, and we are here together because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right.\n\nAUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And I do believe — I do believe that one of the highest forms of patriotism that we could show is to then fight for the ideals of our country. That's what this is about. It is a fight to realize the promise of America. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I know the people of Nevada; you are Battle Born. You are Battle Born. (Applause.) Yes, you are. And we are all ready for the work ahead. Thirty-seven days. (Applause.) Thirty-seven days.\n\nAnd here in Nevada, every voter will receive a ballot in the mail, and in-person early voting starts October 19th. (Applause.)\n\nSo, now is the time to make your plan for how you are going to vote. Okay? And I'd ask you to start making your plan now for how you are going to vote. And if you choose to vote by mail, do not wait. Fill out your battl- — ballot, sign it, and send it back right away. (Applause.) Okay? And tell your neighbors.\n\nBecause, folks, the election is here — (applause) — and we need to energize and organize and mobilize. And remember, your vote is your voice. Your voice is your power. Don't ever let anybody take your power from you. Never. (Applause.) Never. Don't let anybody silence you ever.\n\nSo, Las Vegas, today, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? (Applause.)\n\nDo we believe in freedom? (Applause.)\n\nDo we believe in opportunity? (Applause.)\n\nDo we believe in the promise of America? (Applause.)\n\nAnd are we ready to fight for it? (Applause.)\n\nAnd when we fight —\n\nAUDIENCE: We win!\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: — we win.\n\nGod bless you. And God bless the United States of America. God bless you.

Hi, everyone. Hi. Good afternoon. (Applause.)\n\nCan we please applaud Theresa and her extraordinary courage? Please, can we applaud her extraordinary courage? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nPlease have a seat, everyone. Thank you. It's good to be back in Arizona. (Applause.) It is good to be back in Arizona.\n\nThank you all. Thank you so very much. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE: Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate — thank you so very much.\n\nI — I just want to, for a moment, speak about Theresa. We — we had some time together backstage. And, you know, I think that in moments of crisis, such as the fentanyl crisis, there are people who, through their suffering and their pain, rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don't have that story.\n\nAnd you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important. And, again, I applaud Theresa, and I know we all do. (Applause.) And our need to stop this issue is one of the reasons that we are all here together today.\n\nI also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here.\n\nSenator Mark Kelly, who came with me. (Applause.) He had — and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington, D.C. to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so, I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, who just tore up the floor up. (Applause.) She is, you know, one of — well, I'm going to talk a bit about it in a minute, but some of the work that — that I have done in my career as attorney general and watching her do the work that she has done as attorney general really does emphasize the importance of having the right leader at the right time in the right place, and that's who she is. (Applause.)\n\nMayor Huish, I thank you for the warm welcome. We've spent some time together. You've shared with me the needs of your community. (Applause.) And I thank you for your leadership as well.\n\nAnd to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon.\n\nBefore I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator Criswell, and President Biden and I, of course, will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nWe have mobilized more than 1,500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water, and generators that are ready for deployment, and — (applause) — we are working to restore power for — for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages.\n\nAnd I just want to stress — and for the — the press that is here, to those who are watching — the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly, and lives have been lost, and the risk of flooding still remains high. So, I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So, thank you all.\n\nAnd — and now I'll speak about, in particular, the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today.\n\nSo, Arizona, I think you all know, and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election, and one is the security of our border.\n\nThe United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them, and I take that responsibility very seriously.\n\nWe are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story, and so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane, and that it makes our country stronger. (Applause.)\n\nSo, I've just come from visiting the border and the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure, and they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas — (applause) — and why last December I helped raise the rate of overtime pay for border agents — (applause) — and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year — written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress.\n\nThat bill would have hired 1,500 more border agents and officers. It would have paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally. And it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers.\n\nIt was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol union, and it should be in effect today, producing results in real time right now for our country. (Applause.)\n\nBut Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, ""Stop the bill."" Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. (Applause.) And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. (Applause.)\n\nAnd so, even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the border security bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law. (Applause.)\n\nAnd let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was attorney general of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs.\n\nI walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I've seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room, complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings.\n\nAnd my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings.\n\nMy team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa Cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars' worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cortel — Cartel and broke up a drun- — a drug trafficking operation, including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results.\n\nAs attorney general of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American attorneys general and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican attorneys general to address this issue and, in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity. All of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.\n\nAnd I started, as attorney general, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy.\n\nSo, stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me, and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work, and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nAnd it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace commonsense approaches and new technologies to get the job done, because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs, and human beings, could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. (Applause.) They could care less.\n\nThey've got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for commonsense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don't work together to fix these problems.\n\nAnd look, I — transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So, to disrupt them, we must do the same, and that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding commonsense approaches, not just about some rhetoric at a rally but actually doing the work of fixing a problem. (Applause.)\n\nAnd as president, I won't only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked; I will do more to secure our border.\n\nTo reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum.\n\nWhile we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure, and that is my goal. (Applause.) And that is my goal.\n\nSecuring our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal, so much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl, and their grief is heartbreaking.\n\nAnd the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It's impacting communities across our country, regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you cl- — you choose to talk about. It's a scourge in our country, and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry, like the one I visited today.\n\nThe fact is, border officers don't have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines — more personnel, more training, and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it.\n\nI will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. (Applause.) Yes.\n\nI will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain, because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country.\n\nMy approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States.\n\nOur administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China. (Applause.) Yeah.\n\nAnd all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle, because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that the solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. (Applause.)\n\nAnd on this issue, writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. (Applause.)\n\nAnd let me be clear, I reject the false choice — I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly, and humane. We can and we must do both. (Applause.) We must do both.\n\nAnd we need clear, legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country — (applause) — and we must make our current system work better.\n\nFor example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people's home countries. (Applause.) And as president, I will work with Congress to create, at long last, a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years — (applause) — for years and deserve to have a system that works.\n\nI also have in mind our DREAMers. I have met — (applause) — I have met with so many of our DREAMers throughout my career. They who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way, but still, they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved, at this point now, for decades.\n\nThe same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables — (applause) — and who sustain our agricultural industry, and they, too, have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system.\n\nWell, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions — solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. (Applause.) For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should.\n\nAnd so, as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation, and the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between commonsense solutions and the same old political games.\n\nIn the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge. (Applause.)\n\nAs overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let's talk about that. He separated families. He ripped toddlers out of their mother's arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for DREAMers.\n\nHe made the challenges at the border worse. And he is still — and he is still fanning the flames of fear and division.\n\nAnd let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader, and that is, in fact, I think we all believe, an abdication of leadership. (Applause.)\n\nAnd so, on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump's failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions.\n\nAnd let's see what's happening. Let's not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results.\n\nAs your president, I will protect our nation's sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken — broken system of immigration, and I will partner with Democrats, Republicans and independents to do it. (Applause.)\n\nArizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics, and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger.\n\nAnd I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand, and I know we are ready. (Applause.)\n\nAnd so, with all of that, I say, thank you.\n\nMay God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you all.",Kamala Harris,Vice President of the United States: 2021-2025,Speech/Remarks,Douglas,True,3018,Success
